* Bug fix. Php error in function print_page solved.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.1 - 31-07-2013
* New feature: Load a predefined number of generation blocks at page start. This is a solution for large trees. Choose between 1 to 10 or all generation blocks to load at once.
  Extra blocks will be loaded when clicking on the button below each page or by clicking on a 'follow' link in the last visible generation block without page refresh.
* Re-added improved version of the check relationship function (removed in version 1.0.7). Indicate relationship between partners. Option can be turned on and off in the admin. 
* Better function to count spouses - Thanks to Carl Scase.
* Bug Fix. Fixed the wrong counter increment in the browser Opera. Solved by placing an extra dot after the numbers in the counter increment style in base.css.
* New: Added divorce information.

  Extra information about the partner (father/mother of the children) is added in a tooltip.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.7 - 13-07-2013
* Bugfix: Removed the check_relationship function (added in 1.0.5). It turns out to be really slow on large trees.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.6 - 11-07-2013
* Bugfix: If updated from a previous version but not in sequence, the db_schemes fails. Changed the db_schemes.

==========================================================================================================================
Version 1.0.5 - 10-07-2013
* New feature: Show single persons (persons without partner and children) in each generation block with full details.
  This is an optional feature. Option can be turned on and off on the configuration page.
* Added extra class dynamically through jQuery for parent blocks with images. The css setting min-height is now only set on these blocks.
  This prevents blocks without images from having to much empty space. This mostly happens when the option 'show single persons' is turned on.
* Added some extra space on the top and bottom of the main blockcontent.
* Bugfix: Do not show a family block where the main person is a child with one or both parents listed in the same generation block. 
  If this is the case the children will be listed in the next generation anyway. This prevents double listing of the same person and all his/her next generations.

* Added updated French and German language files.
